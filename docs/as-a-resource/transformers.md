Transformers allow you to transform complex types to simple types. This is useful when you want to transform a data object to an array or JSON.

No complex transformations are required for the default types (string, bool, int, float, enum and array), but special types like `Carbon` or a Laravel Model will need extra attention.

Transformers are simple classes that will convert a such complex types to something simple like a `string` or `int`. For example, we can transform a `Carbon` object to `16-05-1994`, `16-05-1994T00:00:00+00` or something completely different.

There are two ways you can define transformers: locally and globally.

## Local transformers

When you want to transform a specific property, you can use an attribute with the transformer you want to use:

```php
class ArtistData extends Data{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        #[WithTransformer(DateTimeInterfaceTransformer::class)]
        public Carbon $birth_date
    ) {
    }
}
```

The `DateTimeInterfaceTransformer` is shipped with the package and will transform objects of type `Carbon`, `CarbonImmutable`, `DateTime` and `DateTimeImmutable` to a string.

The format used for converting the date to string can be set in the `data.php` config file. It is also possible to manually define a format:

```php
class ArtistData extends Data{
    public function __construct(
        public string $name,
        #[WithTransformer(DateTimeInterfaceTransformer::class, format: 'm-Y')]
        public Carbon $birth_date
    ) {
    }
}
```

Next to a `DateTimeInterfaceTransformer` the package also ships with an `ArrayableTransformer` that transforms an `Arrayable` object to an array.

It is possible to create transformers for your specific types. You can find more info [here](/docs/laravel-data/v4/advanced-usage/creating-a-transformer).

## Global transformers

Global transformers are defined in the `data.php` config file and are used when no local transformer for a property was added. By default, there are two transformers:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Arrayable;
use Spatie\LaravelData\Transformers\ArrayableTransformer;
use Spatie\LaravelData\Transformers\DateTimeInterfaceTransformer;

/*
 * Global transformers will take complex types and transform them into simple
 * types.
 */
'transformers' => [
    DateTimeInterface::class => DateTimeInterfaceTransformer::class,
    Arrayable::class => ArrayableTransformer::class,
],
```

The package will look through these global transformers and tries to find a suitable transformer. You can define transformers for:

- a **specific implementation** (e.g. CarbonImmutable)
- an **interface** (e.g. DateTimeInterface)
- a **base class** (e.g. Enum)

## Getting a data object without transforming

It is possible to get an array representation of a data object without transforming the properties. This means `Carbon` objects won't be transformed into strings. And also, nested data objects and `DataCollection`s won't be transformed into arrays. You can do this by calling the `all` method on a data object like this:

```php
ArtistData::from($artist)->all();
```

## Getting a data object (on steroids)

Internally the package uses the `transform` method for operations like `toArray`, `all`, `toJson` and so on. This method is highly configurable, when calling it without any arguments it will behave like the `toArray` method:

```php
ArtistData::from($artist)->transform();
```

Producing the following result:

```php
[
    'name' => 'Rick Astley',
    'birth_date' => '06-02-1966',
]
```

It is possible to disable the transformation of values, which will make the `transform` method behave like the `all` method:

```php
use Spatie\LaravelData\Support\Transformation\TransformationContext;

ArtistData::from($artist)->transform(
    TransformationContextFactory::create()->withoutValueTransformation()
);
```

Outputting the following array:

```php
[
    'name' => 'Rick Astley',
    'birth_date' => Carbon::parse('06-02-1966'),
]
```

The [mapping of property names](/docs/laravel-data/v4/as-a-resource/mapping-property-names) can also be disabled:

```php
ArtistData::from($artist)->transform(
    TransformationContextFactory::create()->withoutPropertyNameMapping()
);
```

It is possible to enable [wrapping](/docs/laravel-data/v4/as-a-resource/wrapping-data) the data object:

```php
use Spatie\LaravelData\Support\Wrapping\WrapExecutionType;

ArtistData::from($artist)->transform(
    TransformationContextFactory::create()->withWrapping()
);
```

Outputting the following array:

```php
[
    'data' => [
        'name' => 'Rick Astley',
        'birth_date' => '06-02-1966',
    ],
]
```

You can also add additional global transformers as such:

```php
ArtistData::from($artist)->transform(
    TransformationContextFactory::create()->withGlobalTransformer(
        'string', 
        StringToUpperTransformer::class
    )
);
```
