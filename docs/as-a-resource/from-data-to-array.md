title: From data to array

A data object can automatically be transformed into an array as such:

```php
SongData::from(Song::first())->toArray();
```

Which will output the following array:

```php
[
    'name' => 'Never gonna give you up',
    'artist' => 'Rick Astley'
]
```

You can manually transform a data object to JSON:

```php
SongData::from(Song::first())->toJson();
```

Or transform a data object to an array:

```php
SongData::from(Song::first())->toArray();
```

By default, calling `toArray` on a data object will transform all properties to an array. This means that nested data objects and collections of data objects  will also be transformed to arrays. Other complex types like `Carbon`, `DateTime`, `Enums`, ... will be transformed into a string. We'll see in the [transformers](/docs/laravel-data/v4/as-a-resource/transformers) section how to configure and customize this behavior.

If you only want to transform a data object to an array without transforming the properties, you can call the `all` method:

```php
SongData::from(Song::first())->all();
```

## Using collections

Here's how to create a collection of data objects:

```php
SongData::collect(Song::all());
```

A collection can be transformed to array:

```php
SongData::collect(Song::all())->toArray();
```

Which will output the following array:

```php
[
    [
        "name": "Never Gonna Give You Up",
        "artist": "Rick Astley"
    ],
    [
        "name": "Giving Up on Love",
        "artist": "Rick Astley"
    ] 
]
```

## Nesting

It is possible to nest data objects.

```php
class UserData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $email,
        public SongData $favorite_song,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function fromModel(User $user): self
    {
        return new self(
            $user->title,
            $user->email,
            SongData::from($user->favorite_song)
        );
    }
}
```

When transformed to an array, this will look like the following:

```php
[
    "name": "Ruben",
    "email": "ruben@spatie.be",
    "favorite_song": [
        "name" : "Never Gonna Give You Up",
        "artist" : "Rick Astley"
    ]
]
```

You can also nest a collection of data objects:

```php
class AlbumData extends Data
{
    /**
    * @param Collection<int, SongData> $songs
    */
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public array $songs,
    ) {
    }

    public static function fromModel(Album $album): self
    {
        return new self(
            $album->title,
            SongData::collect($album->songs)
        );
    }
}
```

As always, don't forget to type collections of data objects by annotation or the `DataCollectionOf` attribute, this is essential to transform these collections correctly.
