Earlier we saw how default values can be set for a data object, sometimes you want to set a default value based on other properties. For example, you might want to set a `full_name` property based on a `first_name` and `last_name` property. You can do this by using a computed property:

```php
use Spatie\LaravelData\Attributes\Computed;

class SongData extends Data
{
    #[Computed]
    public string $full_name;

    public function __construct(
        public string $first_name,
        public string $last_name,
    ) {
        $this->full_name = "{$this->first_name} {$this->last_name}";
    }
}
```

You can now do the following:

```php
SongData::from(['first_name' => 'Ruben', 'last_name' => 'Van Assche']);
```

Please notice: the computed property won't be reevaluated when its dependencies change. If you want to update a computed property, you'll have to create a new object.

Again there are a few conditions for this approach:

- You must always use a sole property, a property within the constructor definition won't work
- Computed properties cannot be defined in the payload, a `CannotSetComputedValue` will be thrown if this is the case
