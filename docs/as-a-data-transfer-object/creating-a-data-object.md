title: Creating a data object
weight: 1

Let's get started with the following simple data object:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
}
```

Since this is just a simple PHP object, it can be initialized as such:

```php
new SongData('Never gonna give you up', 'Rick Astley');
```

But with this package, you can initialize the data object also with an array:

```php
SongData::from(['title' => 'Never gonna give you up', 'artist' => 'Rick Astley']);
```

You can use the `from` method to create a data object from nearly anything. For example, let's say you have an Eloquent
model like this:

```php
class Song extends Model
{
    // Your model code
}
```

You can create a data object from such a model like this:

```php
SongData::from(Song::firstOrFail($id));
```

The package will find the required properties within the model and use them to construct the data object.

Data can also be created from JSON strings:

```php
SongData::from('{"title" : "Never Gonna Give You Up","artist" : "Rick Astley"}');
```

Although the PHP 8.0 constructor properties look great in data objects, it is perfectly valid to use regular properties
without a constructor like so:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public string $title;
    public string $artist;
}
```

## Magical creation

It is possible to overwrite or extend the behaviour of the `from` method for specific types. So you can construct a data
object in a specific manner for that type. This can be done by adding a static method starting with 'from' to the data
object.

For example, we want to change how we create a data object from a model. We can add a `fromModel` static method that
takes the model we want to use as a parameter:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function fromModel(Song $song): self
    {
        return new self("{$song->title} ({$song->year})", $song->artist);
    }
}
```

Now when creating a data object from a model like this:

```php
SongData::from(Song::firstOrFail($id));
```

Instead of the default method, the `fromModel` method will be called to create a data object from the found model.

You're truly free to add as many from methods as you want. For example, you could add one to create a data object from a
string:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function fromString(string $string): self
    {
        [$title, $artist] = explode('|', $string);
    
        return new self($title, $artist);
    }
}
```

From now on, you can create a data object like this:

```php
SongData::from('Never gonna give you up|Rick Astley');
```

It is also possible to use multiple arguments in a magical creation method:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function fromMultiple(string $title, string $artist): self
    {
        return new self($title, $artist);
    }
}
```

Now we can create the data object like this:

```php
SongData::from('Never gonna give you up', 'Rick Astley');
```

There are a few requirements to enable magical data object creation:

- The method must be **static and public**
- The method must **start with from**
- The method cannot be called **from**

When the package cannot find such a method for a type given to the data object's `from` method. Then the data object
will try to create itself from the following types:

- An *Eloquent model* by calling `toArray` on it
- A *Laravel request* by calling `all` on it
- An *Arrayable* by calling `toArray` on it
- An *array*

This list can be extended using extra normalizers, find more about
it [here](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-data/v4/advanced-usage/normalizers).

When a data object cannot be created using magical methods or the default methods, a `CannotCreateData`
exception will be thrown.

## Optional creation

It is impossible to return `null` from a data object's `from` method since we always expect a data object when
calling `from`. To solve this, you can call the `optional` method:

```php
SongData::optional(null); // returns null
```

Underneath the optional method will call the `from` method when a value is given, so you can still magically create data
objects. When a null value is given, it will return null.

## Creation without magic methods

You can ignore the magical creation methods when creating a data object as such:

```php
SongData::withoutMagicalCreationFrom($song);
```

## Advanced creation using factories

It is possible to configure how a data object is created, whether it will be validated, which casts to use and more. You
can read more about it [here](/docs/laravel-data/v4/advanced-usage/factories).

## DTO classes

The default `Data` class from which you extend your data objects is a multi versatile class, it packs a lot of
functionality. But sometimes you just want a simple DTO class. You can use the `Dto` class for this:

```php
class SongData extends Dto
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
}
```

The `Dto` class is a data class in its most basic form. It can br created from anything using magical methods, can
validate payloads before creating the data object and can be created using factories. But it doesn't have any of the
other functionality that the `Data` class has.
