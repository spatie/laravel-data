It is also possible to write rules down manually in a dedicated method on the data object. This can come in handy when you want
to construct a custom rule object which isn't possible with attributes:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => ['required', 'string'],
            'artist' => ['required', 'string'],
        ];
    }
}
```

By overwriting a property's rules within the `rules` method, no other rules will be inferred automatically anymore for that property.

This means that in the following example, only a `max:20` rule will be added, and not a `string` and `required` rule:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => ['max:20'],
            'artist' => ['max:20'],
        ];
    }
}

// The generated rules will look like this
[
    'title' => ['max:20'],
    'artist' => ['max:20'],
]
```

As a rule of thumb always follow these rules:

> Always use the array syntax for defining rules and not a single string which spits the rules by | characters.
> This is needed when using regexes those | can be seen as part of the regex

## Using attributes

It is even possible to use the validationAttribute objects within the `rules` method:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function rules(): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => [new Required(), new StringType()],
            'artist' => [new Required(), new StringType()],
        ];
    }
}
```


You can even add dependencies to be automatically injected:

```php
use SongSettingsRepository;

class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function rules(SongSettingsRepository $settings): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => [new RequiredIf($settings->forUser(auth()->user())->title_required), new StringType()],
            'artist' => [new Required(), new StringType()],
        ];
    }
}
```

## Using context

Sometimes a bit more context is required, in such case a `ValidationContext` parameter can be injected as such:
Additionally, if you need to access the data payload, you can use `$payload` parameter:

```php
class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function rules(ValidationContext $context): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => ['required'],
            'artist' => Rule::requiredIf($context->fullPayload['title'] !== 'Never Gonna Give You Up'),
        ];
    }
}
```

By default, the provided payload is the whole request payload provided to the data object. 
If you want to generate rules in nested data objects then a relative payload can be more useful:

```php
class AlbumData extends Data
{
    /**
    * @param array<SongData> $songs
     */
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public array $songs,
    ) {
    }
}

class SongData extends Data
{
    public function __construct(
        public string $title,
        public ?string $artist,
    ) {
    }
    
    public static function rules(ValidationContext $context): array
    {
        return [
            'title' => ['required'],
            'artist' => Rule::requiredIf($context->payload['title'] !== 'Never Gonna Give You Up'),
        ];
    }
}
```

When providing such payload:

```php
[
    'title' => 'Best songs ever made',
    'songs' => [
        ['title' => 'Never Gonna Give You Up'],
        ['title' => 'Heroes', 'artist' => 'David Bowie'],
    ],
];
```

The rules will be:

```php
[
    'title' => ['string', 'required'],
    'songs' => ['present', 'array'],
    'songs.*.title' => ['string', 'required'],
    'songs.*.artist' => ['string', 'nullable'],
    'songs.*' => [NestedRules(...)],
]
```

It is also possible to retrieve the current path in the data object chain we're generating rules for right now by calling `$context->path`. In the case of our previous example this would be `songs.0` and `songs.1`;

Make sure the name of the parameter is `$context` in the `rules` method, otherwise no context will be injected.
